Redtrine documentation
======================

Welcome to the official documentation of the `Redtrine` project.

Redtrine is a high-level Redis library for PHP.

It aims to provide a clear interface to implement most of Redis cookbooks in an
easy way using `Redtrine Structures`.

Redtrine is inspired by `Redback`, a high-level Redis library for Node.JS and its
name is also inspired by `Doctrine`, an ORM that provides transparent persistence
for PHP objects.
